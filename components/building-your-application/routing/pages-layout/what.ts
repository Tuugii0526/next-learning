    TEMPLATE:
    Template is similar to layout ,but there is a difference . The difference is that when path is changed , template will be rerendered- all the states will be abolished.
    METADATA:
    You should not use title and head tags . Instead you should use METADATA API , which will handle all the rest problems.
